Project Scope: Study of Informal Economy in Europe
Introduction
This project focuses on the comprehensive study of the informal economy in Europe. We aim to gain insights into the factors that drive the informal economy, understand its impact on income inequality, and test various hypotheses related to this complex economic phenomenon.

Methods Used
To achieve our research objectives, we employ the following methods and techniques:

Regression Analysis: We conduct regression analysis, including simple, multiple, dummy variable, and interaction term regressions. These statistical techniques allow us to explore the relationships between various independent variables and the dependent variable of interest.

Panel Data Analysis: Our study utilizes a panel data approach, which involves analyzing data from multiple time periods and geographic regions. This method helps us capture the dynamic nature of the informal economy across Europe.

Hypothesis Testing: We rigorously test multiple hypotheses to uncover the relationships between regressors and the regressand, providing valuable insights into the informal economy's functioning.

Research Focus
Our primary area of interest is the examination of how independent variables such as poverty rate, access to information, healthcare expenditures, and education expenses influence income inequality. By studying these variables, we aim to shed light on the economic dynamics of the informal sector and its implications for income distribution.
